First, we will review the overall success and failures of kickstarters in the US by category:

Based on this, we see that music & theaters have the greatest number of successful outcomes (success is defined by either meeting or exceeding fundraising targets). 

Knowing that you are interested in creating a kickstart specifically within theatre, we can take a closer look at which Kickstarters within this parent outcome have seen the most success:

These findings indicate that Plays specifically have seen the greatest success, and also historically no cancellations in the US.
