# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

This Kickstarter Analysis was initiated to support a client, Louise, in developing a successful Kickstarter Campaign in Theatre based on a dataset of previous Kickstarter Campaigns. Once Louise Launched her campaign for her play, _Fever_, in a short amount of time she came close to her fundraising goal. After this, Louise requested analysis on the success, failure and cancellations of previous campaigns in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Original data set did not include subcategories as it's own metric - isolated this in order to analyze the outcomes based on goals specifically within the subcategory of plays.

Tydying data - the orignial set included UNIX timestamps that did not support analysis. Required creating addition colums to the corsheet to create use-able data. Same with isolating the year of the kickstarter campaign in order to analyze outcomes based on launch date. 

In the analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals, adjusted the "under 1000" row to < 1000 so that it appeared first in the Line Chart when organized in ascending order (otherwise it would show up at the end). 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
